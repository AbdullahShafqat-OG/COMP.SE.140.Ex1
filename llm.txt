LLM Usage Report

Used tools:
Claude Code (Anthropic)
ChatGPT (OpenAI)

Motivation/reason:
I had a rough draft of my report and wanted help cleaning up grammar, improving sentence flow, and formatting the text so that it reads more clearly.
Additionally, I needed to generate a system architecture diagram to visually present the setup of the microservices, so I used ChatGPT for image generation.

How and why it helped:
Claude Code suggested clearer sentence structures, fixed grammar issues, and improved formatting. This made the report more fluent and easier to read.
ChatGPT created a visual diagram based on my text-based draft, which helped me present the architecture in a professional and clear way.

Mistakes:
Claude Code sometimes added fluff content to the report which had to be manually removed.
ChatGPTâ€™s diagram layout initially needed some adjustments to match exactly what I had described.

Limitations:
The LLMs did not know the course-specific requirements, so I had to make sure the final text and diagram matched the assignment instructions and kept all technical content intact.
