LLM Usage Report

Used tool:
Claude Code (Anthropic)

Motivation/reason:
I had a rough draft of my report and wanted help cleaning up grammar, improving sentence flow, and formatting the text so that it reads more clearly.

How and why it helped:
Claude Code suggested clearer sentence structures, fixed grammar issues, and improved formatting. This made the report more fluent and easier to read.

Mistakes:
The AI added fluff content to the report which had to be manually removed

Limitations:
The LLM did not know the course-specific requirements, so I had to make sure the final text matched the assignment instructions and kept all technical content intact.
